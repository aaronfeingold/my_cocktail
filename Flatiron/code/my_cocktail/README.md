Welcome to myCocktail, an app for storing cocktail recipes in a personal database.

To use, first run 'bundle install' in your terminal. Then use rake migrations to install all of the local files. Next, run 'shotgun' in your terminal. Finally, in a web browser like chrome, go to http://localhost:9393/ to use. You can create a new user name and password and begin to create new libations!
